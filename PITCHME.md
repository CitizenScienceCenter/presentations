#### How can this be achieved?

* Shared contacts and communication
* Act as a single entity
* Understand responsibilities
* One team = one love
* Hack days, open days (not just with UZH/ETH; use existing meetups. Let Fanny roam!)
* More presence - Skype is not a solution
  * Sorry Rosy! I believe the MD should be in ZH >=3 days a week
