## What is great and unique about co-created Citizen Science Zurich Style?

### What is great about `Co-Created`?

* All actors involved from the start
* Sense of ownership from all involved
* Sharing of information, not just 'tasks to complete'
* More incentives to participate

---

### Why we (CCCS) aren't doing it...

* Current projects already designed by researchers
* Limited Citizen Science `research` expertise (PWA has it!)
* No real criteria on how projects are selected
  * Mainly `gut feeling` - (again, PWA can help here!)
* We only have the platform, no public facing assistance
* No `matchmaking` citizens with relevant researchers - minimal outreach with citizens
* No central, open directory of running projects within UZH and ETH

### What is great about Zurich Style?

* I am not sure of the definition!
  * Take it away, Mike!

**WARNING! Opinions!** - Citizen Science only entered the English language in 2014, adding words to it in a non Native English country could alienate the citizens further. Perhaps define what **we** mean by Citizen Science and use the `research` term only in publications?

### Why we (CCCS) aren't doing it?

* **1** Project from UZH, **0.5** from ETH
* We are not focussing on visibility in Zurich
    * Rather on national or international visibility

---

* I feel that (and I may be wrong about some of these things):
  * there is limited active recruitment or advertising within either university
    * See previous point about collecting running projects as a directory
---
* I feel like:
  * we are 'collaborating' with U of Geneva
    * projects come from there and not ETH/UZH
    * funding goes to them based on our successes (grants applied for based on Snake project)
    * little/no help from their side (all commits come from Chris and Marcel)
        * > 10 hours spent supporting projects outside of the Center by Chris in 2019
    * This collaboration takes most of our time and resources and defines our goals/deadlines
        * i.e. snake challenge
    * These should be used solely for ETH and UZH projects from **now** on

---

* I also feel that:
  * The SDG Toolkit is not in our strategy (or discussed at the General Assembly) but it is a high priority
    * If we are a partner then it should be public and an official collaboration between the UN/EEB should be in place and agreed by the board/upper management
    * Current efforts toward it should **stop** and development should focus on the platform outlined in the strategy
