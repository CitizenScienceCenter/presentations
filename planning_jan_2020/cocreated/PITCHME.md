## What is great and unique about co-created Citizen Science Zurich Style?

### What is great about `Co-Created`?

* All actors involved from the start
* Sense of ownership from all involved
* Sharing of information, not just 'tasks to complete'
* More incentives to participate
* 'True' citizen science

---

### Why we (CCCS) aren't doing it...

* Current projects already designed by researchers
* Limited Citizen Science `research` expertise (PWA has it!)
* No real criteria on how projects are selected
  * Mainly `gut feeling` - (again, PWA can help here!)
* We only have the platform, no public facing assistance
* No `matchmaking` citizens with relevant researchers
* No central, open directory of running projects within UZH and ETH

### What is Zuerich Style?

* Take it away, Mike!

--- 

### Why we (CCCS) aren't doing it?

* **1** Project from UZH, **0.5** from ETH
* Visibility in Zurich is more important than internation or even international visibility

---

* I feel that (and I may be wrong about some of these things):
  * there is limited active recruitment or advertising within either university
    * See previous point about collecting running projects 
  * we are collaborating with U of Geneva that is not in our strategy
    * But takes most of our time and resources
    * These should be used solely for ETH and UZH projects from **now** on

---

* I also feel that:
  * The SDG Toolkit is not in our strategy (or discussed at the General Assembly) but it is a high priority

    * If we are a partner then it should be public and an official collaboration between the UN/EEB should be in place and agreed by the board/upper management
    * Current efforts toward it should stop and development should focus on the platform outlined in the strategy
